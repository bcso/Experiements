## Setup

1. Webpack setup and dev server + server setup
- webpack was built following [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-webpack-for-react-a36d4cac5060/)
- webpack packages up javascript/css files to /dist, which are hashed (with [hash]) and pointed to the html file `index.html` created by HtmlWebpackPlugin which uses the same `index.html` file as a template
- sever created by node.js in `server.js`
